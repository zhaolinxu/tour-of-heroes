The title is an homage to the <a href=\"https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/\">Angular 2 Tutorial</a>, which I read a whole lot of while working on this.</p>\n\n<h2>Tips</h2>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>You can speed up your current action by clicking the progress bar.</li>\n    <li>Certain zones have events which can only occur once per lifetime that award a massive number of skill points. Have you slayed the Bat King yet?</li>\n    <li>The \"Heroic Ancestry\" buff is key to progressing to the late game.</li>\n    <li>It generally pays to focus on breadth over depth. Raising two classes to level 50 will give a higher Ancestry bonus than raising one class to level 100.</li>\n    <li>If an action trains more than one skill at once and you're under-leveled for more than one, the slowdown penalty will be compounded.\n        <ul>\n            <li><b>Example:</b> You're level 8 in Piety and Combat. Action A trains Piety and requires level 10 to master. Action B trains Combat and is mastered at level 10. Action C trains Combat and Piety and is mastered when both skills are level 10. A and B will have slowdown penalties of 100%. C will have a slowdown penalty of 300%.</li>\n            <li>However, actions that train multiple skills give more SP than single-skill actions of the same difficulty.</li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>Slowdown can be reduced by increasing your level, even if you don't train any of the skills involved in that zone.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\n\n<p>All unit icons come from the excellent open-source tactical RPG <a href=\"https://www.wesnoth.org/\">Battle for Wesnoth</a>. The skill icons were borrowed from <a href=\"https://crawl.develz.org/\">Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup</a>.</p>\n</div></div>\n    "
